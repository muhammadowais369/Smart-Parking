# Smart-Parking
The increasing global trend toward urbanization has led to a significant rise in vehicle
ownership, making urban traffic management and parking availability a critical challenge.
Traditional parking systems, often characterized by manual monitoring and a ”first-come,
f
irst-served” approach, result in increased fuel consumption, traffic congestion, and driver
frustration as individuals circle blocks in search of available spaces. To address these inef
f
iciencies, the Smart Parking System leverages modern Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT) to automate and optimize the parking process.
Our project focuses on an integrated, automated solution designed to streamline the
entry, monitoring, and exit phases of parking management. By combining hardware
sensors with cloud-based data management, the system provides a seamless experience
for both the facility operators and the end-users.
The Smart Parking Embedded System demonstrates a robust integration of mechatronic
components and software services. By offloading the management of parking slots to
an MCU-driven sensor network and utilizing a cloud DBMS for user interaction, the
system provides a scalable solution to modern parking challenges. This project serves as
a foundational model for ”Smart City” infrastructure.
